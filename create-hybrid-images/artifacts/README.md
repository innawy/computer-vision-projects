Project 1 - Hybrid image
Inna Lin (wl676)
'''

The hybrid image is constructed by two self-portraits of the Dutch painter Rembrandt van Rijn.
The left (low-pass) image (painting in 1629) is when he was a young man.
The right (high-pass) image (painting in 1669) is when he was at 63 years old.
When the viewer look from a distance, they can see a young man in a plumed beret, full of hope.
When they look closer, they will see the wrinkles on his face, after 40 more years of living and hard work.
