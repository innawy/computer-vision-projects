# Projects in Computer Vision

1. Create hybrid images
- Image filtering functions based on a simplified version of 2006 paper by Oliva, Torralba, and Schyns. 

2. Feature detection, description, and matching
- robustly compare images with differences in position, orientation, and illumination.
- Detection: Harris corner detection
- Description: Simple descriptor based on pixel intensity, MOPS feature descriptor
- Matching: SSD (Sum of squared differences), ratio test

3. Autostitch - Panoramas
